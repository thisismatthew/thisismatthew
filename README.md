**What I'm working on**

I'm currently working a residency at The Arcade Melbourne as a part of thier SMART program. While I'm there I'll be refactoring my game _My Arms Are Longer Now_ so that it is a lot more organised and less so game-jam-code. I'll also be putting the final touches on another game _Bottled!_ that i have been working on as part of my final capstone project at Swinburne University.

**What I do here**

Predominantly small indie games and prototypes as well as the occasional AI project. Feel free to pull any of my games, though if you want a stable build you'll have much more luck over at thisismatthewj.com.
