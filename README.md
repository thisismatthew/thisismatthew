**What I'm Up-to**
I'm currently working as one half of Toot Games, a Vicscreen funded Indie Development Studio in Meblourne, working on My Arms Are Longer Now. Other than that I'm tinkering on jam games and little side projects when able. 

**My Latest Projects**
At the beginning of 2022 I completed a residency at The Arcade Melbourne as a part of thier SMART program. While I was there I was developing my game _My Arms Are Longer Now_. I've also been putting the final touches on another game _Bottled!_ that i was working on as part of my final capstone project at Swinburne University in 2021. After graduating I worked for a year as a content designer at Firemonkeys on Need For Speed: No Limits.

**What I do here**

Predominantly small indie games and prototypes as well as the occasional AI project. Feel free to pull any of my games, though if you want a stable build you'll have much more luck over at thisismatthewj.com.
